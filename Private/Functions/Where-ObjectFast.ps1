      .SYNOPSIS
      Faster Where-Object

      .DESCRIPTION
      Where-ObjectFast can replace the built-in Where-Object and improves pipeline speed considerably.
      Where-ObjectFast supports only the scriptblock version of Where-Object, so you can replace

      Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.Status -eq 'Running' }

      with

      Get-Service | Where-ObjectFast { $_.Status -eq 'Running' }

      but you cannot currently replace the short form of Where-Object:

      Get-Service | Where-Object Status -eq Running

      Where-ObjectFast has a performance benefit per iteration, so the more objects
      you send through the pipeline, the more significant performace benefits you will see.

      Where-ObjectFast is using a steppable pipeline internally which performs better.
      However because of this, the debugging experience will be different, and internal
      variables such as $MyInvocation may yield different results. For most every-day tasks,
      these changes are not important.

      A complete explanation of what Where-ObjectFast does can be found here:
      https://powershell.one/tricks/performance/pipeline

      .EXAMPLE
      $stopwatch = [System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch]::StartNew()

      $result = 1..1000000 | Where-ObjectFast -FilterScript {
      $_ % 5
      }

      $report = '{0} elements in {1:n2} seconds'
      $report -f $result.Count, $stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds

      Demos the speed improvements. Run this script to see how well it performs,
      then replace Where-ObjectFast with the default Where-Object, and check out
      the performace difference. $result is the same in both cases.
