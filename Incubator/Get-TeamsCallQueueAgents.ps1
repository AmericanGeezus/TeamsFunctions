#Idea: Run Get-TeamsCallQueue to translate the items, then return a custom object with only the following:
# Name and ID of the Queue
# OverflowActionTarget (if any)
# TimeoutActionTarget (if any)
# Users (UPNs as String (comma, separated))
# Agents (UPNs as String (comma, separated))
# Groups (Group Names as String (comma, separated))
# Resource Accounts (UPNs, as String (comma, separated))
# Resource Accounts for CallerId (UPNs, as String (comma, separated))

# omit the rest.
