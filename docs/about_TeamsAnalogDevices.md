﻿# Teams Common Area Phones

## about_TeamsCommonAreaPhone

## SHORT DESCRIPTION

There are currently no native commands for this, so I am trying to create them.

## LONG DESCRIPTION

Analog Devices in Teams behave differently than they do in Skype for Business. There is no Object created in Teams that represents this Analog Device. Instead, this is done via a Contact Object, to put a Name to a Number.

> [!NOTE] These CmdLets are not yet built! I have sketched out what is needed to build these CmdLets, but haven't had the time to build them yet. The links below will not work.
