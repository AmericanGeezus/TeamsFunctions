SHORT DESCRIPTION
    There are currently no native commands for this, so I tried creating them.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Analog Devices in Teams behave differently than they do in Skype for
    Business. There is no Object created in Teams that represents this Analog
    Device. Instead, this is done via a Contact Object, to put a Name to a Number.
    > [!NOTE] These CmdLets are not yet built! I have sketched out what is
    needed to build these CmdLets, but haven't had the time to build them yet.
    The links below will not work.
