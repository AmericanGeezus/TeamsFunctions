SHORT DESCRIPTION
    There are currently no native commands for this, so I tried creating them.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Common Area Phone being User Accounts could be managed with the normal Voice
    Configuration CmdLets, though not very well. The object returned by GET is
    tailored more towards the needs of a Common ara Phone

EXAMPLES
    Please see the Examples for the individual CmdLets in the
    DOCs

NOTE
    The most recent addition to the fold, they need some serious testing before
    they are ready for prime time.

Development Status
    CmdLets are not tested yet.

TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE
    Unit-tests for these CmdLets are not yet available.
    CmdLets are fully built (RC), but not much testing time has yet been spent
    on them. Please be patient with me on these and submit issues as you find
    them.
