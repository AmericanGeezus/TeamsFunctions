    >
    !NOTE] Get-AzureAdLicense forms the baseline of the Licensing functions,
    reading directly from [Microsoft Docs
    . This bears the risk that an update to the site may break all Licensing
    functions, but it also gives you the most up to date Licensing information
    available.

EXAMPLES
    `powershell
    Get-TeamsUserLicense -Identity John@domain.com

    `
    Example 1 queries license related elements for a User and returns a custom
    Object incl.PhoneSystem and PhoneSystemStatus

    `powershell
    Set-TeamsUserLicense -Identity John@domain.com -Add Office365E3,PhoneSystem

    `
    Example 2 assigns the Office 365 E3 License and the PhoneSystem License to
    the User

    `powershell
    Set-TeamsUserLicense -Identity John@domain.com -Add Office365E5 -Remove Office365E3

    `
Example 3 replaces the Office 365 E3 License for an E5 License.

    `powershell
    Set-TeamsUserLicense -Identity John@domain.com -Add PhoneSystemVirtualUser -RemoveAll

    `
    Example 4 replaces all assigned licenses with a PhoneSystem Virtual User License.
    > [!NOTE] When removing a License from a User, the Users will lose the
    functionality the license provides. For example, the E3 or E5 License
    contain a Service Plan for Exchange which will give the User a Mailbox.
    Completing a License Operation (in PowerShell or in the Admin Center) will
    trigger the subsystem to process these. When replacing a License, Microsoft
    recommend to do it in one step as the Example 3 and 4 above illustrate.

NOTE
    Replacing Licenses should be performed in one step to retain the
    functionality throughout the process.
    Resource Accounts can be set up with any License, but ideally utilise the
    free PhoneSystem Virtual User License available in the Tenant. Should those
    license become available later, Resource Accounts may become unusable if the
    PhoneSystem licenses are not replaced in one step.

Development Status
    Development is complete. As always, some gremlins might still lurk in my
    code, please let me know.

TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE
    Thoroughly tested, but Unit-tests for these CmdLets are not yet available.
