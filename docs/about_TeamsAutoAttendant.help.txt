SHORT DESCRIPTION
    My take on AutoAttendants with more integrated options and defaults.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The complexity of the AutoAttendants and design principles of PowerShell
    ("one function does one thing and one thing only") means that the
    `CsAutoAttendant` CmdLets are feeling to be all over the place. Multiple
    CmdLets have to be used in conjunction in order to create ONE Auto
    Attendant. No defaults are available. The `TeamsAutoAttendant` CmdLets try
    to address that. From the basic NEW-Command that - without providing
    any
    Parameters (except the name of course) can create an Auto Attendant entity.
    This simplifies things a bit and tries to get you 90% there without lifting
    much of a finger. Amending it afterwards in the Admin Center is my current
    mantra. See Support Functions for more versatility!

    `Get-TeamsAutoAttendant`
    | Get-CsAutoAttendant    | Queries an Auto Attendant

           Set-TeamsAutoAttendant | Set-CsAutoAttendant    | Changes an Auto
    Attendant with friendly input. Alias to Set-CsAutoAttendant only!

    `New-TeamsAutoAttendant`

    `Remove-TeamsAutoAttendant`
    | Remove-CsAutoAttendant | Removes an Auto Attendant from the Tenant

    > [!NOTE] Currently `Set-TeamsAutoAttendant` and `Set-TeamsAA` are currently
    only Aliases to `Set-CsOnlineAutoAttendant`. If I find a better use case to
    write these, I will, but for now they have to stay as they are. I only added
    the aliases to complete the set and provide a consistent look-and-feel in
    case people are natively using them.

Support CmdLets
    Creating a Menu or a Call Flow feels clunky to me, the commands require
    excessive chaining in order to create a full Auto Attendant. The complexity
    of the AutoAttendants also has spawned a few support functions. Keeping in
    step with them and simplifying their use a bit is what my take on them represents.

    files

NOTE
    Removing complexity without sacrificing functionality is a hard thing and
    while writing these CmdLets I learned to appreciate and understand why they
    are how they are.
    That said, I think I have achieved my goal to provide some options to create
    AutoAttendants easier and faster with PowerShell. For any functionality not
    available yet, I usually supplement by selecting in the Admin Center (This
    also serves to double-check everything is set as desired)

Development Status
    The main functionality is built, tested and live.  The only big topic as yet
    to be integrated is HolidaySets
    Planned:
    - Creating a HolidaySet (Schedule) for Holidays of a specific country for a
    specific year
    - Adding, removing and replacing(!) HolidaySets from Auto Attendants.
    - Adding default options to New-TeamsAutoAttendant with a switch <br />NOTE:
    This functionality is already available as a CallFlow and
    CallHandlingAssociations-Object btw.

TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE
    Thoroughly tested, but Unit-tests for these CmdLets are not yet available.
