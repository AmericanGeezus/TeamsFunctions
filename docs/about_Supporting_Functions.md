### Backup and Restore

Taking a backup of every outputable CmdLet that Teams has to offer. Curtesy of Ken Lasko

| Function                                            | Description                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`Backup-TeamsEV`](Backup-TeamsEV.md)         | Takes a backup of all EnterpriseVoice related features in Teams.                                                    |
| [`Restore-TeamsEV`](Restore-TeamsEV.md)       | Makes a full authoritative restore of all EnterpriseVoice related features. Handle with care!                       |
| [`Backup-TeamsTenant`](Backup-TeamsTenant.md) | An adaptation of the above, backing up as much as can be gathered through available `Get`-Commands from the tenant. |

> [!NOTE] The Get-Commands in this function is currently static. While this is fine for Backup-TeamsEV, `Backup-TeamsTenant` may see drift as a result. If additional Get-Commands are added to Teams, this command will need an update. Please let me know. An Automatic mechanism to discover these is desired.

### Helper functions

String reformatting is needed to normalise Numbers as E.164 numbers and allow a more diverse input (like: `'+1(555)-1234 567'`) it also serves to normalise DisplayNames and UPNs should characters be used that are not allowed.

| Function                                                                              | Description                                                                                                                  |

### Test & Assert Functions

These are helper functions for testing Connections and Modules. All Functions return boolean output. Asserting the Status of the SkypeOnline Connection however also tries to reconnect a broken session in the hope of reducing downtime.

| Function                                                                      | Description                                                                                                 |

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1 - Formatting

```powershell
'+1(555)-1234 567' | Format-StringForUse -As E164
# This will format the String as an E.164 number and return `+15551234567`

'+1(555)-1234 567' | Format-StringForUse -As LineUri
# Example 2 will format numbers as a TEL URI
# This will format the String as a LineUri to be used in Teams and return `tel:+15551234567`.
```

Note, LineUris _could_ also have an extension set, but this example focuses on the Number normalisation aspect.  This CmdLet can also normalise DisplayNames and UserPrincipalNames and verifies their limitations.

## NOTE

None.

## Development Status

Mature. All of these CmdLets are pretty static and only receive minor updates.

The String manipulation ones even have Pester tests defined already.

## TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE

Unit-tests are available for Format-CmdLets

All others, though thoroughly tested, have no Unit-tests yet available.

## SEE ALSO

None.
