SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Callable Entities are Objects that CQs or AAs can direct calls to.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Each type of Object has different requirement to meet before they can be
    used. Users, for example need to be Licensed with Teams and PhoneSystem,
    which not only has to be assigned but the respective ServicePlan must be
    enabled before they can be enabled for Enterprise Voice. Once enabled, they
    can receive a Phone Number in order to place or receive calls via the PhoneSystem.
    These scripts aim to address all these requirements and validate them before
    allowing them to be used. They feed into Call Queue and Auto Attendant
    CmdLets that make heavy use of them.

NOTE
    The Concept of a Callable Entity is introduced with Auto Attendants where
    Call Targets need to be created as a Callable Entity before they can be used
    for an Auto Attendant.
    The other CmdLets expand on this concept:
    - `Assert-TeamsCallableEntity` was broken out of the Get-TeamsCallableEntity
    and will assert whether the Object is in a state to be used as a Call Target
    - `Get-TeamsCallableEntity` will identify and assert whether the Object is
    in a state to be used as a Call Target and is the backbone of the CallQueue
    and AutoAttendant improvements in this Module
    - `Find-TeamsCallableEntity` finds whether the Object provided is used on
    any Call Queue or Auto Attendant

Development Status
    Complete.

TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE
    Thoroughly tested, but Unit-tests for these CmdLets are not yet available.
    As they are so integral to this Module, they should not throw any Errors, if
    they do they will be addressed swiftly.
