NOTE
    This seems to be a constant work-in progress so please bear with me with any
    issues you may find. I am addressing them pretty rapidly, but I am doing
    this alone and outside my day-job in my spare time. Cheers.

REQUIREMENTS
    - PowerShell v5.1 is required,
- PowerShell v7.1 throws an error
    when connecting to AzureAd
    <br />Currently no connection is possible! - Module `MicrosoftTeams`
    - Module `AzureAd` or `AzureAdPreview`
    Some functions are only available with the Preview module until they become
    generally available and move to the AzureAd Module
    > [!NOTE] The Module `SkypeOnlineConnector` is deprecated and has been
    removed as a dependency from this Module with v21.2 - Connection is now
    solely established with the MicrosoftTeams Module
