SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Administering Call Queues with friendlier names.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Call Queues with friendly inputs! Use the DisplayName to find and address
    changes to Call Queues. Instead of having to manually input the File and
    provide an ID to the CallQueue CmdLet, this now also uses Friendly Filenames
    and performs the import for you.
    Call Targets (
    `CallableEntities`
    verified, Users are - if licensed - enabled for EnterpriseVoice too. All
    requirements and dependencies are processed with visual feedback.
    Microsoft is continuing to improve these scripts, so I hope these can stand
    the test of time and make managing Call Queues easier.
    > [!NOTE] Microsoft has selected a GUID as the Identity the `CsCallQueue`
    scripts are a bit cumbersome for the average admin. Though the Searchstring
    parameter is available, enabling me to utilise it as a basic input method
    for `TeamsCallQueue` CmdLets. They query by
    DisplayName
    , which comes with a drawback for the `Set`-command: It requires a unique
    result.

EXAMPLES
    EXAMPLE 1 - QUERY
    Get-TeamsCallQueue [-Name] "Test"
    # Queries all Call Queues with the Name 'Test' (full name)
    
    Get-TeamsCallQueue -SearchString "Test"
    # Queries all Call Queues with the String 'Test' in the name (search)

    Where `-Name` targets the exact Name and can use the pipeline,
    `-SearchString` gives you an opportunity to find the Call Queues with
    similar names.

    EXAMPLE 2 - CREATING A NEW CALL QUEUE WITH DEFAULTS
    New-TeamsCallQueue [-Name] "My Queue"
    # Creates a Call Queue with improved defaults
    # Thresholds: Overflow 10, Timeout 30s
    # Improved defaults also cover the default MusicOnHold
    
    New-TeamsCallQueue [-Name] "My Queue" -UseMicrosoftDefaults
    # Creates a Call Queue with Microsoft defaults (thresholds)
    # Thresholds: Overflow 50, Timeout 1200s

    For more detailed examples, please see the Docs for the individual CmdLets

    EXAMPLE 3 - SETTING WITH THE PIPELINE
    Get-TeamsCallQueue -Name "My Queue" | Set-TeamsCallQueue -OverflowThreshold 120
    
    # Queries all Call Queues with the Name 'My Queue' (full name) and changes the OverflowThreshold.
    # Good for changing one or more Queues to the same setting, though handle with care!

    Please note that the Name is not a unique criteria, you may have multiple
    that are called the same. Following Example #1, this can also be used to
    change multiple Call Queues at the same time with `-SearchString`

    EXAMPLE 4 - REMOVING WITH THE PIPELINE
    Get-TeamsCallQueue -SearchString "Test" | Remove-TeamsCallQueue -Confirm
    
    # Queries all Call Queues with the String 'Test' in the name and removes them. Prompts for confirmation for each.
    # Handle with care!

NOTE
    Pipelines are available, as they are bound to the Name, this name must be
    unique (unless queried with Get first and the result being piped, where I
    bind to the individual ID instead). Bulk updating is available - see example
    above, but handle with care.  Best to capture the Queues to be changed in a
    variable and double-checking you got the correct ones (and only those)
    before running. Additionally, `-Confirm` can help.

Development Status
    Developing and testing these is very time consuming. I learned a lot while
    doing them, but as hard as I try, they probably still contain a few bugs.

TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE
    Thoroughly tested, but Unit-tests for these CmdLets are not yet available.
    They are quite mature already, but if you do encounter issues, please
    capture verbose and debug output as they help me immensely when
    troubleshooting.
