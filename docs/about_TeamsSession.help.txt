SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Creating a PowerShell Session to Teams/SkypeOnline  with MicrosoftTeams
    v2.0.0

LONG DESCRIPTION
    SkypeOnline and MSOnline (AzureADv1) are the two oldest Office 365 Services.
    Creating a Session to them was not implemented very nicely. The Modules
    `MicrosoftTeams` (v2 and higher) and `AzureAd` alleviate most of the issues
    the community had with the connection, but I think they can still use some
    magic These CmdLets try to provide said magic and enhance the experience dramatically.
    The introduction of Privileged Identity Management and Privileged Access
    Groups further requires some manual steps that these are trying to make
    simpler and provide an easier way to connect and activate your roles

CmdLets
    | Function                                                    | Description 
                                                                                
                                                       | |

    | |
    `Connect-Me`
    in one go. Only displays
    ONE
    authentication prompt, and, if applicable,
    ONE
    MFA prompt! Also tries to enable your Admin Roles in PIM. | |
    `Disconnect-Me`
    | Disconnects form all Sessions to SkypeOnline, MicrosoftTeams and AzureAD  
                                                                      |
    Connect-Me aims to solve the issue of having and maintaining a connection to
    all Office 365 needed for Administration. In most cases, that will be
    AzureAd and MicrosoftTeams/SkypeOnline, but could also need ExchangeOnline

Admin Roles
    Activating Admin Roles made easier. Please note that Privileged Access
    Groups are not yet integrated as there are no PowerShell commands available
    yet in the AzureAdPreview Module. This will be added as soon as possible.
    Commands are used with `Connect-Me`, but can be used on its own just as well.
    > [!NOTE] Please
    note
    , that Privileged Admin Groups are currently not covered by these CmdLets.
    This will be added as soon as they have been fully documented and PowerShell
    CmdLets are available for them.

    and available
    > [!NOTE] While Assert-MicrosoftTeamsConnection is powerful, I cannot
    overload it. At a certain point I have to leave the decision to the
    Administrator on how to proceed > This includes the infamous
    `StepablePipelineError` which doesn't hint towards to PIM Admin roles to be
    activated. Please run `Connect-Me` again to rectify.

EXAMPLES
    EXAMPLE 1 - CONNECTING TO AZUREAD, MICROSOFTTEAMS
    `powershell
    Connect-Me [-AccountId] John@domain.com

    `
    Establishes a session to AzureAd, enables Admin Roles (with AzureAdPreview),
    Connects to MicrosoftTeams

    EXAMPLE 2 - CONNECTING TO AZUREAD, MICROSOFTTEAMS AND EXCHANGEONLINE
    `powershell
    Connect-Me [-AccountId] John@domain.com -Exchange

    `
    Establishes a session to AzureAd, enables Admin Roles (with AzureAdPreview),
    Connects to MicrosoftTeams and ExchangeOnline

Background
    To properly administer Teams, a connection to `AzureAd` is most likely
    needed. This Module and all functions therefore tie closely to an existing
    Azure-Ad Connection. Assertions are performed when the respective sessions
    are required. For best performance, connections should start with running
    `Connect-Me` which will connect to both.
    > [!NOTE] Privileged Identity Management and Role Activation are currently
    only available with the Module `AzureAdPreview` installed in Version
    `2.0.2.24` or higher, until the functions become generally available through
    the AzureAd Module. > If the Module is not installed, a warning is displayed
    that the functions are not available.

NOTE
    Cleanly disconnecting a session has many benefits. First, it removes the
    Connections and prepares your PowerShell window to be able to be reused for
    connections to other Tenants.
    Second, it removes all Global Variables set during use (The name is starting
    with "TF"). This ensures that customer data is cleared up. This includes all
    Azure Ad Groups, Licenses, etc. queried and stored or better overall
    performance!

Development Status
    Mature. Fine-tuning is still in progress. Privileged Identity Management
    Roles may still an update.

TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE
    Thoroughly tested, but Unit-tests for these CmdLets are not yet available.
    To effectively manage multiple tenants, please disconnect your session
    cleanly (with `dis`), before reconnecting.
    Privileged Identity Management Role activation depend heavily on the
    settings in the Tenant. If you find a scenario not working for you or
    producing errors, please open an issue.
