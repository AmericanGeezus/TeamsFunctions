SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Connecting to the Teams Backend is, for now, still done through SkypeOnline

LONG DESCRIPTION
    SkypeOnline and MSOnline (AzureADv1) are the two oldest Office 365 Services.
    Creating a Session to them is not implemented very nicely. These CmdLets try
    to address this.
    The introduction of Privileged Identity Management and Privileged Access
    Groups further requires some manual steps that these are trying to make
    simpler and provide an easier way to connect and activate your roles

CmdLets
    | Function                                                    | Description 
                                                                                
                                                       | |

    `Connect-SkypeOnline`
    | Creates a Session to SkypeOnline                                          
                                     | |
    `Connect-Me`
    | Creates a Session to SkypeOnline and AzureAD in one go. Only displays
    ONE
    authentication prompt, and, if applicable,
    ONE
    MFA prompt! Also tries to enable your Admin Roles in PIM. | |
    `Disconnect-SkypeOnline`
    | Disconnects from a Session to SkypeOnline. This helps preventing timeouts
    and hanging sessions                                                       |
    |
    `Disconnect-Me`
    | Disconnects form all Sessions to SkypeOnline, MicrosoftTeams and AzureAD  
                                                                      |
    Connect-Me aims to solve the issue of having and maintaining a connection to
    all Office 365 needed for Administration. In most cases, that will be
    AzureAd and SkypeOnline, but could also need ExchangeOnline and
    MicrosoftTeams (which is now being tethered to SkypeOnline if the
    CsOnlineSession is created with the Module MicrosoftTeams)

Admin Roles
    Activating Admin Roles made easier. Please note that Privileged Access
    Groups are not yet integrated as there are no PowerShell commands available
    yet in the AzureAdPreview Module. This will be added as soon as possible.
    Commands are used with `Connect-Me`, but can be used on its own just as well.
    > [!NOTE] Please
    note
    , that Privileged Admin Groups are currently not covered by these CmdLets.
    This will be added as soon as they have been fully documented and PowerShell
    CmdLets are available for them.

    Attempts to reconnect
    a timed-out session. Alias `PoL`
    Ping-of-life

    The Assert cmdlets are nested in all Scripts to ensure sessions are created
    and available

EXAMPLES
    EXAMPLE 1 - CONNECTING TO AZUREAD, MICROSOFTTEAMS
    `powershell
    Connect-Me [-AccountId] John@domain.com
    # Establishes a session to AzureAd, enables Admin Roles (with AzureAdPreview), Connects to MicrosoftTeams

    `

    EXAMPLE 2 - CONNECTING TO AZUREAD, MICROSOFTTEAMS AND EXCHANGEONLINE
    `powershell
    Connect-Me [-AccountId] John@domain.com -Exchange
    # Establishes a session to AzureAd, enables Admin Roles (with AzureAdPreview), Connects to MicrosoftTeams and ExchangeOnline

    `

NOTE
    To properly administer Teams, a connection to `AzureAd` is most likely
    needed. Privileged Identity Management and Role Activation are currently
    only available with the Module `AzureAdPreview` installed in Version
    `2.0.2.24` or higher, until the functions become generally available through
    the AzureAd Module.
    > [!NOTE] Most Functions and CmdLets in this module rely on a connection to
    AzureAd as well as SkypeOnline.
    Initially, this module was built around the use of the Module
    `SkypeOnlineConnector`(v7). The Connector is now deprectated and this Module
    does no longer require it to be installed. The command to establish a
    connection has been ported to the Module `MicrosoftTeams` (in v1.1.6) which
    is a requirement for this Module.
    The Connection CmdLet does behave slightly differently: Seamless
    Single-Sign-On is not available, the Account needs to be selected manually.
    Please see detailed notes in
    `Connect-Me`
    for details.

Development Status
    Mature, but a bit of a moving target - Continuously 'in Progress'. An update
    to the MicrosoftTeams Command and documentation is anticipated that would
    enable Single-sign-on with MFA enabled. Issues have been raised via Github
    to address.

TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE
    Thoroughly tested, but Unit-tests for these CmdLets are not yet available.
    Please disconnect your session cleanly, before reconnecting. I have found
    that, when using the MicrosoftTeams Module, the whole PowerShell Session
    needs to be recreated which is annoying. This is still evaluated and tested
    with every PreRelease.
    The Session can also currently not be reconnected to, a credential Dialog is
    shown with the Username "oAuth". Please cancel this and the following empty
    credential dialog and run Connect-Me again. This will try to reconnect. I am
    trying to write a script that can catch that and try to reconnect you more
    cleanly.
