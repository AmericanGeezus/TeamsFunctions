## Introduction

This module exists as many of Microsofts Teams back-end (SkypeOnline) Cmdlets are too clunky to handle easily on a daily basis without building a big library of quirks and GUIDs and snippets as well as a growing understanding of all the pitfalls and requirements needed for individual features.

The goal is to make this easier for day-to-day use, to simplify the input and to feed back good information if not successful.
Teams evolves constantly, so does this Module: Released monthly, with weekly pre-releases.

### Installation

```powershell
# Release (Monthly)
Install-Module TeamsFunctions

# PreRelease (weekly)
Install-Module TeamsFunctions -AllowPrerelease
```

### Content

- Consistently handling Sessions Connection to AzureAd, MicrosoftTeams and SkypeOnline
- Improving Admin Authorisation with Privileged Identity Management Role Activation
- Improving User Administration for Licensing, Direct Routing and Calling Plans
- Enabling Administration for Common Area Phones, Analog Contact Objects, etc.(WIP)
- Improving Migration and Enablement tasks for Teams Users' Voice Configuration
- Improving Teams Resource Accounts, Call Queues and Auto Attendants
- Improving Day-to-day Administration with little helpers

- A detailed breakdown of changes for Pre-Release Versions is recorded in [VERSION-prerelease.md](VERSION-prerelease.md)

## Development

### Current Focus

- Performance improvements, bug fixing and more testing
- Adding Functional improvements to lookup
- Adding individual Scripts to ease admin tasks
- TeamsCommonAreaPhone CmdLets (Testing)
- TeamsAnalogDevice CmdLets (Design & Build)

### Extension plans

- Figuring out Pester, Writing proper Test scenarios
- Standing up a full CI/CD Pipeline with Appveyor (most is done manually presently)
- Comparing backups, changed elements for Change control... Looking at Lee Fords backup scripts :)

### Limitations

- Privileged Admin Groups cannot be queried via PowerShell yet.
- Testing: Currently, only limited Pester tests are available for the Module and select functions.
No Pester tests exist for Functions that require a Session to AzureAd or SkypeOnline - I cannot figure them out yet. All Testing is done with VScode and my trusty ISESteroids.

## Final Word

I hope you enjoy using this module and its functions as much as I do :)
