# TeamsFunctions - Change Log - PreReleases

Pre-releases are documented here and will be transferred to VERSION.md monthly in cadence with the release cycle

## v21.01.10 pre-release - TBA

### New

- HELP! - Using PlatyPS to add Markdown Help files. Special thanks to [Andrés Gorzelany](https://github.com/get-itips)
- `Find-TeamsUserVoiceRoute`: Now formally new and working as intended
  - Given a user and a Dialled Number, it evaluates the Effective Dial Plan and Effective Voice Route and displays all in a neat output


### Updated

- TBA

---------------------------------------------

### Pipeline

- More module related Tests to really make this one as sturdy as I can
- More function tests, again, once I figure out Mocking
- Automated Testing for multiple PowerShell versions
- AppVeyor CI/CD build
- Automated Workflow for releases and prereleases (like posting this update on my blog :))
