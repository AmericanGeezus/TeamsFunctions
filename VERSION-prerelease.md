- TBC

### ToDo

- Pipeline tests:
  - Test piping objects with UserprincipalName and Identity to GET-CmdLets and SET-CmdLets
  - Test output of objects with and without Identity against Microsoft CmdLets
- Rework Get-TeamsCallQueue and Get-TeamsAutoAttendant to also accept the ObjectId as input
- `Assert-MicrosoftTeamsConnection`: Evaluate Reconnection with Connect-MicrosoftTeams if unsuccessful.

---------------------------------------------

### Pipeline

- More module related Tests to really make this one as sturdy as I can
- More function tests, again, once I figure out Mocking
- Automated Testing for multiple PowerShell versions
- AppVeyor CI/CD build
- Automated Workflow for releases and prereleases (like posting this update on my blog :))
